In this project, List-To-Do is a helpful tool for keeping track of your daily tasks and to-do items, built using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, with ReactJS as the primary framework. With its simple and intuitive interface, it makes it easy to create and manage your lists.

To use List-To-Do, simply go to the link: https://list-to-do-seven.vercel.app/ and start by creating a new list. You can add as many tasks as you like, and you can also mark them as completed when you've finished them.

One of the great features of List-To-Do is that you can create multiple lists, each with its own set of tasks. This makes it easy to keep track of different types of tasks, such as work tasks, household chores, or personal goals.

In addition to creating lists, you can also set a due date for your tasks. Simply select a task, and then click on the "Add Task" button.
